**Code Example for Custom Tracking Page:**

```javascript
// Enhanced tracking page component
const TrackingPage = ({ orderData, trackingInfo }) => {
  return (
    <div className="tracking-container">
      <div className="brand-header">
        <img src="/your-logo.png" alt="Brand Logo" />
        <h1>Track Your Order #{orderData.orderNumber}</h1>
      </div>
      
      <div className="progress-section">
        <ProgressBar 
          currentStep={trackingInfo.currentStep}
          steps={['Confirmed', 'Processing', 'Shipped', 'Delivered']}
        />

    const expectedDeliveryPassed = hasExpectedDeliveryPassed(order);
    
    return hoursSinceLastUpdate > 48 || expectedDeliveryPassed;
  });
  
  for (const order of suspiciousOrders) {
    await sendProactiveUpdate(order, {
      type: 'delay_alert',
      message: 'We noticed your package may be experiencing delays...',
      actions: ['track_package', 'contact_support', 'request_refund']
    });
  }
};
```

**Expected Reduction**: 20-25%

### Pillar 4: Smart Email Automation
